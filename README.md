# CSS in JavaScript Applications

A CSS-in-JS library makes it easy to implement, and manage styles in React js projects. Styles converges at the component level and are generated as props from state changes. It dynamically enforces "Dead Code Elimination" by scoping styles. It resolves conflictsin in CSS global  properties and values by creating unique hashes.

## Benefits

1. CSS-in-JS promotes explicit, traceable and granular dependencies.

2. Encourages the coupling of CSS and HTML.

3. Enforces State-based styling

One of the very powerful patterns CSS-in-JS enables is state-based styling. Technically it is usually implemented as a JavaScript function which receives a state object and returns CSS properties. As a result, a CSS rule is generated that corresponds to the state of an element. Compared to a more traditional way, where we build a class attribute containing multiple class names, this has some advantages

4. Gives developers API to describe state-based styles in a better way than using a bunch of conditional class names.

5. Makes dependencies explicit because variables always reference the value in code visually. They are traceable because we can statically analyze where the value comes from. 

6. They are granular because we can reuse CSS values, properties or entire style blocks as we see fit.


## Flexbox against CSS Grid

CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a one-dimensional system (either in a column or a row). A core difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox is that â€” CSS Grid's approach is layout-first while Flexbox' approach is content-first.

When working on either element (row or column), you are most associated with the content. Flexbox, here, gives you more flexibility.

Grid is much newer than Flexbox and has a bit less browser support. That's why it makes perfect sense if people are wondering if CSS grid is here to replace Flexbox. ... Flexbox can do things Grid can't do. They can work together: a grid item can be a flexbox container.
